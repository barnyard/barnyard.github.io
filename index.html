		<h2>What is (was) Pi?</h2>
		<p>
			The Pi project was an effort to create a massively scalable application substrate
			for the development of Cloud and other applications and services, driven by the need
			to support a proprietary cloud platform consisting of many thousands of machines
			providing compute, storage and network services.
		</p>
		<p>
			A fully functional, API-compatible clones of Amazon's EC2 and S3 services were created
			and released in a 'private cloud' scenario.
		</p>

		<h2>Status</h2>
		<p>
			Shortly after Pi won the internal award for Most Innovative Software Product in early 2011,
			strategic realignment and organisational seismics put a stop to the development effort. Although Pi
			remains in use, it is effectively on life support.
		</p>
		<p>
			The codebase was open-sourced in 2012 in an effort to extend its lifespan. It is also our
			desire to preserve and share the successes and learnings from developing and deploying a platform
			with a demanding set of infrequently encountered design goals.
		</p>
		
		<h2>About this site</h2>
		<p>
			The software has been in production use since 2011, however given its status you are
			advised to look at currently active projects such as OpenStack.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this stage, the open-sourced software stack is most likely to be useful as a reference
			for anyone with an interest in or looking to build highly scalable infrastructure software
			services.
