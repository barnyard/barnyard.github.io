			<h3>Hello!</h3>
			<p>
				The Pi project was an effort to create a massively scalable application substrate for
				the development of Cloud and other applications and services.
			</p>
			<p>
				A fully functional, API-compatible clones of Amazon's EC2 and S3 services were created
				and released in a 'private cloud' scenario.
			</p>
			<h3>Status</h3>
			<p>
				Strategic realignment and organisational seismics eventually put a stop to
				the development effort in 2011. Although Pi remains in use, it is effectively on
				life support.
			</p>
			<p>
				The codebase was open-sourced in 2012 in an effort to extend its lifespan, as well as to
				preserve and share the experiences and learnings from developing a platform with the
				particular set of design goals.
			</p>
			<h3>Can I use Pi?</h3>
			<p>
				The software has been in production use since 2011, however given its status you are
				advised to look at currently active projects such as OpenStack.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this stage, the open-sourced software stack is most likely to be useful as a reference
				for anyone with an interest in or looking to build highly scalable infrastructure software
				services.
